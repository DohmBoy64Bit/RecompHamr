# Current Transitional Architecture

Stage A is accepted. Stage C slice 1 moved process startup and composition into `internal/app` without changing the concrete TUI contract.

```text
cmd/recomphamr

    v
internal/app
    +--> internal/config
    +--> internal/llm
    +--> internal/tui
              |
              +--> internal/agent
              +--> internal/config
              +--> internal/ctx
              +--> internal/llm
              +--> internal/provider
              +--> internal/tools
```

## Completed ownership

- `cmd/recomphamr` parses process-level help/version arguments, delegates application startup, and converts startup errors into the process exit contract.
- `internal/app` owns working-directory discovery, configuration bootstrap, environment overrides, LLM-client construction, debug-log lifecycle, absolute project identity, concrete frontend construction, accepted inline-screen clearing, Bubble Tea creation, and program execution.
- The architecture check prevents the process entrypoint from bypassing `internal/app` to import runtime or presentation packages directly.

## Remaining temporary ownership

Stage C slice 2 is in progress. `internal/agent` now owns the production request-packing/tool-schema helpers and the pure assistant/tool classification and nudge text contracts. `internal/tui` still owns configuration reload/model persistence, the mutable model-facing history, chat-stream lifecycle, tool dispatch, cancellation, accounting, and policy latch decisions. The TUI delegates to the extracted pure contracts through temporary compatibility helpers so the accepted tests remain intact while asynchronous ownership moves in later checkpoints.

Backend packages must not import `internal/tui`. `internal/app` is the sole current exception because a composition root must select the concrete frontend. Later slices replace that concrete runtime coupling with typed frontend contracts while preserving the accepted layout and behavior.
